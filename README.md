# From Data to Delivery: Data-Driven Engineering of Last-Mile Optimization for Quick Commerce in Rome and Montreal

This repository contains the full code, data, and model artifacts for my master's thesis project at LUISS Guido Carli. The project focuses on engineering and benchmarking advanced courier assignment strategies for last-mile delivery in quick commerce, using data-driven and machine learning approaches.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DavidPaquette99/From-Data-to-Delivery-Data-Driven-Engineering-of-Last-Mile-Optimization-for-Quick-Commerce-in-Rome-.git
    cd From-Data-to-Delivery-Data-Driven-Engineering-of-Last-Mile-Optimization-for-Quick-Commerce-in-Rome-
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run a sample simulation**
    ```bash
    cd Code/simulation
    python Run_Simulation.py
    ```
    *(You may need to adapt paths depending on your use case. See `Code/README.md` for details on modules.)*

## Data

- All cleaned and processed data for **Montreal** and **Rome** are provided in `Data/Montreal/` and `Data/Rome/`.
- Trained ANFIS models and scalers are in `Data/ANFIS/` and used for courier assignment and regression models.

*No sensitive or private data is included. For full raw datasets or Google API keys, please contact the author.*
